# Meeting notes from the first video call with Professor Camps

Majority of mutations you find will likely have nothing to do with resistance because the mutation rate is so high in HIV.
In E. coli drug resistant genes, you will expect most mutations taht you find are going to have somethign to do with resistance, but it's nto the case for HIV.
You find all kinds of mutations in HIV, not just those due to drug resistance.
Need to focus on spectrum as a signature for the polymerase rather than the mutations as sources for mutations.

Profile of 12 possible bp substituions, but double-stranded stage of virus brings that down to 6 possible bp substitutions.
Look at percent of each of the 6 changes gives a rough profile.
More recently, people have been looking at two neighboring nulceotides, not just those change.
This gives you a more high resolution profile.
With the numbers we have, going to that 96 may be reaching. Ie we don't have enough mutations.

Kinetics of structure with PyRosetta.
That alone won't go far.
If you find a mutaiton that seems to alter the spectruem and the structure suggest is critival for discrimination, then it's useful for us.

What parts are critical for functionality?
Given by other papers.  Studies of polymerases.  Find the papers given in his proposal document.

Six pais of mutation types give by figure with black/white columns.

Figure 2 shows which areas of the polymerase are functionally important.

Not every mutation, just every mutation that is KNOWN to be a drug-resistant mutations.
Well-known positions given in a popular paper.

(5:00)
Figure 2 shows drug-resistance mutations.
Compare indexes to compare how different the profile of this mutatant is to the total.
Higher bar --> more likely ot have a differnt profile.

(5:30)
Higher bar --> more different the spectrum was.

(5:35)
Figure 3.
Black --> spectrum from one mutant.
White --> spectrum from another mutant.
They are different.
This is captured in the comparison index from Fig 2.
Difference b/w mutant and rest of pop. fo rthe nuc profile.
